                Hello, My name is Akshay Shivkumar. I am a junior
                Computer Science Major with a Machine Learning Concentration at the University of Maryland-College Park.
                I plan on pursuing a math minor in addition to my intended Major
                of Computer Science. Outside of school, I am broadening my education
                by learning Keras and am working to sharpen my skills as a full stack developer. I am currently 
                working on becoming an Amazon Certified Solutions Architect. In the future,
                I hope to take machine learning classes as I am interested in this topic, and believe
                 that it will vastly change the world in years to come. In school, I am currently taking
                 Computer and Network Security and learning Machine Learning having already completed the object oriented classes and 
                 discrete math. I am always looking to grow as a programmer and hope to one day work in the industry.
